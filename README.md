# Article DAO for HRF 

A project to help HRF human rights activists to 
communicate their experiences, views, and thoughts 
in the world about second and third generation rights.

With commands as easy as saying a few words, learning 
this program would be as easy as learning how to read! 
Users can write articles, read, create decentralized publishing groups and genres. 

Along with the HRF, this project is made to support my work and research on the cryptocurrency industry, and how it's impacting the lives of people outside the world 
of finance. 

# Spicee Chain

This Article DAO is powered by a custom-chain named Spicee. Made in Python, Spicee allows users to create tokens (for publishing and creating genres), and publish articles with no cost. 

Spicee is designed to have no transaction fee as the blockchain relies on the user's own hardware to use less energy to preserve the enviornment when mining blocks. 

Moreover, when publishing the article, there is no extra 
cost as we understand the need to express views and opinions freely. 

## Tokenizing

Users can also create tokens to add custom functionality to their Article DAO. All they need to do is create a 
`class` variable, and a block as a type `dict`.

Then to publish it to the Spicee network, users can create all functions and add it manually to the chain with the command: `Spicee.chain.append(TOKEN_BLOCK_NAME)`. 

*Note*: Sample Tokens have been added already to the native program: *Genres* and *Publishing to a Publisher*. You can view `genre_token.py` or `tokenizing.py` as a reference. 

Tokens allow for users to use the program for many reasons with endless possibilities. Preserving human rights and voicing opinions is important and we recognize that our DAO must be designed to meet those needs and exceed them.

Along with the chain, tokens are made in Python as it 
is an easy language to read and understand. No custom libraries, no advanced mathematical functions, just simple basic syntax used to make a bigger impact.

### Publishing Token

One of the custom tokens already integrated to the native program is called the `Publisher`. It allows users to create their own publishing group and add it to the article DAO for users to submit their work in. It cross-references the creator so they know what type 
of articles are being made. 

It should be noted that future profanity filters will be made, but at the moment, this program allows for human rights activists to communicate and voice their opinions together with ease. 

### Genre Token

Another custom token natively integrated to the program is `Genre`. This allows for users to filter their search more specifically to specific political topics and human rights issues. 

This is made to ease and simplify the searching process 
for human rights activists.

# Mining Protocol

The Spicee Chain runs on the Sha-256 hash protocol along 
with Proof-Of-Work. Although it Proof-Of-Work is not 
as energy-efficient, we ensured that the difficulty for the program to validate the chain is to four zeros instead of eight or sixteen. This reduces energy consumption by over 60% supporting the third-generation rights of having a clean enviornment.
