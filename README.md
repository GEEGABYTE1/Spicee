# Article DAO for HRF 

A project to help HRF human rights activists to 
communicate their experiences, views, and thoughts 
in the world about second and third generation rights.

With commands as easy as saying a few words, learning 
this program would be as easy as learning how to read! 
Users can write articles, read, create decentralized publishing groups and genres. 

Along with the HRF, this project is made to support my work and research on the cryptocurrency industry, and how it's impacting the lives of people outside the world 
of finance. 

# Spicee Chain

This Article DAO is powered by a custom-chain named Spicee. Made in Python, Spicee allows users to create tokens (for publishing and creating genres), and publish articles with no cost. 

Spicee is designed to have no transaction fee as the blockchain relies on the user's own hardware to use less energy to preserve the enviornment when mining blocks. 

Moreover, when publishing the article, there is no extra 
cost as we understand the need to express views and opinions freely.
